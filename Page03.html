            <font size="4px"><p>Items are important for boosting characters’ attributes like attack speed or maximum hit points (HP). They can be purchased with gold by tapping the shopping cart below the minimap or by selecting from two preset options.</p>
                <!--Used <sup> & <strike> tag-->
                <p>There are three tiers of item strength: The 1<sup>st</sup> tier items are the cheapest, most basic items, while Tier 3 items are very expensive but offer multiple advantages to the player. Furthermore, higher tier items require ownership of lower tier items to be available for purchase. <strike>Check the Armory guide for more details.</strike></p>
                <p>The items are additionally split into five categories: Attack, Magic, Defense, Movement, and Jungling. Choosing items that fit your character and/or the strategy you wish to employ in a particular game is crucial to achieving victory.</p>

                <p>Unique to Arena of Valor are Arcana, which are special tokens available to players once they reach level seven. Affixing Arcana to slots in your Arcana page grants you additional attributes that boost your character from the start of the game. While they have limited influence in the late game, Arcana are very important for securing an early lead.</p>
                <p>Arcana are split into three different categories: red for attack, purple for life, and green for defense. They’re further divided into three levels, where level 3 Arcana grant the most additional attributes in exchange for the steepest prices. Higher-level Arcana as well as slots on your Arcana page are earned by increasing your player level.</p>
                <p>It’s important to note that Arcana are character-specific, so you’ll need to purchase Arcana for each character you wish to play. However, Arcana can be sold back for a full refund, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different combinations to find the best fit for your playstyle.</p><br />
