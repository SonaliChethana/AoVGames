            <font size=4px><p>There are 64 <a href="#a" name="Top">heroes</a> in the game (varying depending on the region you’re in), split into six different categories: Assassin, Mage, Marksman, Support, Tank, and Warrior. Assassins, Mages, and Marksmen are all heavy damage dealers, but they deliver the damage in different ways. Support characters aid their allies by preventing or healing damage taken by enemies. Tanks and Warriors have a large pool of health, and thus absorb damage while disrupting opponents by stunning and displacing them.</p>
               <p>Here’s a quick list in image form for you social media users out there. Scroll past for full explanations of hero placement.</p>

               <p>Assassins are heroes that specialize in killing enemies quickly. They are usually very mobile and have high burst damage. Assassins are usually played in the jungle role, where they can roam around the map and gank enemies.</p>

            <font size="4px"><p>Each hero has a unique set of abilities that can be upgraded by leveling up in-game. Heroes can also purchase items to increase their stats and abilities. Each hero has a unique role that they are best suited for, but they can be played in other roles as well. For example, a hero that is best suited for the jungle role can also be played in the mid lane or the dark slayer lane.</p>

                <li><b>DS Lane</b> - Dark Slayer Lane (or just solo/side lane, if you have a dedicated roaming support). You’re good at solo-laning. Sit in the corner and soak those minion waves.</li>
                <li><b>Support</b> - Characters who fare much better when travelling with a damage-dealing ally. If you’re alone, it’s because you’re scouting out the enemy or purposely allowing teammates to farm more experience and gold.</li>
                <li><b>Damage</b> - Follow up on your team’s initiation by bringing the heat. Position-wise, you are in the Abyssal lane solo or duo.</li>
                <li><b>Mid</b> - The middle lane: typically mages who can clear safely (with some exceptions).</li>
